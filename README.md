# eBird-R-Tutorial
Advanced Data Analysis @ Bucknell - Project 1

In order to access this tutorial, you will need to download a couple of documents. To do this, click the green "Clone or Download Button" on the repo's main page. Then, click "download ZIP". This folder should now be in your downloads folder. Unzip it by clicking to open it, then move it to a location such as your desktop.

Open this folder and then find the "eBird_R_tutorial.Rmd" file. This is the R markdown file which is the tutorial you will be following to complete your assignment. This file contains a general introduction to R Studio that explains the layout and structure needed to work through the file. It also contains a guided tutorial that will help students navigate R to succesffuly interpret a bird-related dataset. Wherever you moved your R markdown file to and opened it will become your "working directory," where R will look to find the data files necessary to go through the tutorial.

To tell R where to find this working directory, go to the R Studio menu at the top of your computer where it has drop downs for "File", "Edit", etc. Open up the "Sessions" drop down, which is located in the middle. Then, click "Set Working Directory" and select "Choose Directory". Within the file explorer that will appear, find where you stored the new folder you created for this project. Select the folder and click "Ok" to set it as your working directory. To confirm, this is where you should have moved the folder you cloned from github.

Through step by step instructions, you should attack the tutorial one code chunk at a time. This will ensure you understand how R works and what you're doing. In large chunks of code, you should still try running each line separately to determine the direct output. To run one line of code at a time, click on the line and then hit command + enter. If at any point you get stuck during this tutorial, do not hesitate to use your friend Google! While this tutorial should provide all the code you need, the internet is a great resource for learning R and finding code that has worked for other people doing similar analyses to you. For the most part, everything that you want to do in R has already been done and can be easily accessed online.
