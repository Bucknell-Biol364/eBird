Despite being somewhat windy, it is a good day for migrants.  Unusual bird of the day is the Worm-eating, which we chase for awhile, give up on, and then fortuitously meet up with again.  It sings frequently, but not so often that it is easy to--find.  Actually stays somewhat high in the trees, and does not move around that frequently.  Bird until late morning - fun trip!

Coffey was an officer at Ft. Sill from January 1943 - May of 1944. The field data is from the estate of Ben B. Coffey. He was a member of the Memphis Chapter of the Tennessee Ornithological Society. Lula Coffey joined him for part of his military career. --The number of miles is not correct as no distance was recorded.   Area birded:  Ben and Lula birded along Cache Creek from Quarry Hill woods to N of the Hoyle Bridge.--Ben Coffey identified birds by sight and sound. Please note that Ben Coffey's bird recordings from Central and South American are now at the Bio-acoustics at the University of Florida. His United States recordings are at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Ben Coffey was an amateur ornithologist but because of his scientific contributions he was elected as a Fellow of the AOU in 1991.--Entered by Martha Waldron, MTOS member,  April 2016.

This was the remnants of a massive fallout from a front that came through Friday. Spent  much time on the east side of the river and at Peveto on west side.  With my father and the LOS spring meeting..  Some numbers below (ducks, herons) were just checked in my notes and I have put X for those numbers that are not clear.  One of the interesting findings was the change in numbers of some migrant warblers from prior day.  For example, we had very few Magnolia and Chestnut-sided Warblers on Saturday but they were remarkably common on Sunday (in the same woods) but the Bay-breasted warblers that were common on Saturday were missing on Sunday.

The effluent from Pond 4 was piped under the expressway and distributed over a fenced area by an above ground pipe and sprinkler system. This area was / is bounded by the expressway, College, Sandhill, and Hagadorn.----Dr. Beaver, the Ornithology Prof at the time, developed a point count census along two straight line transects (east-west), having 4 labelled segments, for a total of 80 stations. I believe the lines were in the SE quadrant of the area, and included fields and woods. The idea was to establish baseline population numbers and see what changes occurred (or not) through time. Several students, including myself, carried out the censusing, which also included a few free walks though the census area.

The effluent from Pond 4 was piped under the expressway and distributed over a fenced area by an above ground pipe and sprinkler system. This area was / is bounded by the expressway, College, Sandhill, and Hagadorn.----Dr. Beaver, the Ornithology Prof at the time, developed a point count census along two straight line transects (east-west), having 4 labelled segments, for a total of 80 stations. I believe the lines were in the SE quadrant of the area, and included fields and woods. The idea was to establish baseline population numbers and see what changes occurred (or not) through time. Several students, including myself, carried out the censusing, which also included a few free walks though the census area.----Time, route, numbers for species recorded on data sheets, not so much in my journal. Out with Al Aulette in the morning.

Light to heavy rain (at times had to hide in the shelter at Peveto because rain was so heavy).  Northerly winds.  Heavy fallout occurring. Flocks of birds were seen to come in from the gulf and over the beach. Amazing spectacle.  There was a Black-throated Gray Warbler reported from Peveto and we thought we had it but were not able to confirm for sure.  Some numbers below (ducks, herons) were just checked in my notes and I have put X for those numbers that are not clear.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Still hearing a male Ring-necked Pheasant calling off in the distance.  When walking up the driveway to get the Sunday paper, I did a check of the bluebird box I erected last month next to the driveway, adjacent to the field.  To my surprise, it had a bluebird nest with 5  blue eggs.  I can¿t tell you the thrill I felt.  I have never seen or heard a bluebird along this property, or when I drove by the box twice a day for the last 6 weeks!  This is the first bluebird I have ever attracted to a box I put up.  It¿s the same kind of thrill I felt last year when I had an SY male martin checking our my gourd rack here.  This year I have been clearing several more trees in front of the deck, in preparation of putting up a T-14 wooden martin house with starling-resistant entrance holes.  I also plan a second, much larger pond.  My deck bird feeders are attracting lots of House and Purple Finches, cardinals, and Cowbirds.  Saw some Ruddy Ducks on the pond.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

Br[ight] sun in a.m. Tremont to Furnessville Trail via Tr[ail] 2, to Paradise Valley, to Big Blowout to Tremont....Cardinal, wood thrush, field sparrow, house wren, red start, maryland yellowthroat, jay, red-eyed vireo, and wood pewee joined in the evening song but one by one dropped out leaving the robin to the end. He at length replaced by the whip-poor-will....Saw a digger wasp followed wherever it went at a distance of about six inches by a much smaller fly (latter probably seeking to parasitize the wasp's eggs[)]. In the Big Blowout saw a large Carabid beetle (resembling Pasimachus depressus). The trail of the creature made a network over the sand; in one place a trail ceased abruptly and was replaced by crow's track. BOTANICAL NOTES: Wild strawberries just ripening, Juneberries green as yet. Saw several yellow lady slippers in bloom in conservatory - late. Puccoon and beach pea, with the yellow beach thistle blooming prostrate on the sand, were flowering along the lake edge. Bumble bees seeking honey thronged the thistle....Today photographed Liparis liliifolia - 4 plants, one of which started late still in very tight bud, two about 1/3 in bloom, while the fourth and largest had (9) nine flowers and (5) buds. The flowers have a long period as the first one opened early last week and has not yet shriveled. [Milton Adair (20 Mar 1898 - 20 Dec 1986) kept hand-written notebooks, spanning 27 Mar 1932 - 28 May 1976, focussed on wildlife (flora and birds in particular) of the Chicago area. The first three years of his notebooks mostly address the phenology of plants (particularly at the Indiana Dunes). His attention to birds increased somewhat in 1935. The year 1936 marks a turning point in Adair's journals, including bird data on all 47 dates of entry; more information on populations; his first entries from Chicago (including 13 entries from Jackson Park); and a larger number of complete checklists (including 29 out of 30 checklists from the Indiana Dunes, but only one complete checklist from Jackson Park). Data transcribed and uploaded to eBird in 2019 by Paul R. Clyne. Ellipses (...) generally indicate blocks of text that are discontinuous in Adair's notes, not omissions from the transcript. Additional transcriber's comments are enclosed in [square brackets].]

In Hamburg we had a warm front move over the region with thunderstorms and a ¼ of rain. However, viewing conditions were poor along Northkill Road and many warblers passed through the treetops without identification. The count along Northkill Road was very inefficient, but still resulted in 58 species of birds, including 19 species of warblers identified. Conditions worsened before reaching the mountaintop. Visibility started to falloff noticeably beyond 20 feet with wind-driven drizzle. There were a good number of territorial warblers here, but migrants were clearly along the base of the mountain.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload.

There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Iliff, and uploaded to observer-specific accounts on behalf of the observers. UTM coordinates were converted from lat-long values, times estimated assuming start time of 5:15 and 15 minutes to conduct survey and travel to next point, and the taxonomy updated prior to upload. All counts were conducted with 8-minute count periods reporting all birds seen or heard and recording distance to bird using variable circular counts method (distance sampling not included in this eBird upload). There were weather conditions under which a count was not conducted (e.g., wind, rain). Counts were conducted from 05:15 to 09:15 and count periods were sometimes extended for one hour on Maui because of stops because of rain. Uploaded under eBird's Stationary protocol. These surveys were conducted with the support of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hawaii GAP, The Nature Conservancy - Hawaii, State of Hawaii Department of Forestry and Wildlife, Kamehameha Schools, Hawaii Natural Heritage Program, Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit - University of Hawaii, U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Basin Information Node - U.S. Geological Survey and Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center of Biological Resources Division - U.S. Geological Survey.

Potter (1883–1963), former president and honorary member of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC). Potter kept copious notecards, each with a survey very similar to the format of eBird, including counts of each species and notes on nesting behavior, etc. His records have been stored at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia since his death, and are in the process of being digitized for posterity by a team of volunteers, coordinated by Matthew R. Halley (Editor of the DVOC).----This survey was entered into eBird by Emily Ostrow on 22 May, 2016. The following field notes were copied verbatim: Date: Jan 1 1929, Temp: 45° F, Locality: Collingswood to Haddonfield via Cooper Creek, Wind: East, Weather: Rain, Fog.","",NA
